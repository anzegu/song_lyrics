<b>DESCRIPTION</b>

------------------------------------------------

This is an app for song lyrics. Everyone can view lyrics, search them in the search bar or by clicking on a letter which is 
located at the top of the page.

Creating an account is possible with email or by logging into facebook or steam. Users have the option of changing their username and
password.

A user can then add lyrics to a song through the add page. On the page he must select the author, album, genre, type the name
and upload a document with the lyrics in it. If an author or album does not exist in the database, there are links on the page through
which the user can add them. Once the file is uploaded it won't be displayed on the main page, until the admin verifies it 
(admin recieves a notification).

The admin has an overview of the database on his account. There he can delete users, artists, albums and songs if there are spelling errors.
